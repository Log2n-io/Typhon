# Chain Walk Correctness Under Compaction
> The visibility walk scans a `Versioned` component's whole revision chain rather than stopping at the first too-new entry — because background revision GC can reorder entries physically without changing their TSNs.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented · **Visibility:** Internal · **Category:** [Revision](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

[MVCC Snapshot Visibility](./mvcc-snapshot-visibility.md) promises that a read resolves the latest revision
committed at-or-before the reader's TSN. The naive way to implement that — walk the chain in physical order,
stop at the first entry whose TSN exceeds the reader's snapshot — is wrong on Typhon's revision chain: cleanup
compaction can relocate a later-committed revision into an earlier physical slot than an older one, so the
chain's physical order and its commit-TSN order can diverge. A walk that breaks early can therefore skip the
revision a reader was actually entitled to see, returning a stale or wrong value with no error.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

`RevisionChainReader.WalkChain` always processes every live entry in the chain — never breaking on the first
`TSN > transactionTSN` it meets — and keeps the highest-TSN entry that is both committed (`!IsolationFlag`) and
at-or-before the reader's TSN, voided entries skipped along the way. An entry's `IsolationFlag` stays set until
its writing transaction calls `Commit`, which is what makes an uncommitted entry invisible to every reader,
including the writer's own later reads through this same path (read-your-own-writes is served separately, from
a per-transaction cache, not from the chain). One fast path exists: a single-entry, already-committed chain — the
common steady state for an entity not under concurrent write contention — resolves directly off the chain header
without constructing the full walk or taking the chain's read lock at all.

## 💻 Usage

There's no separate API for this — it's the resolution step inside every `Versioned` read (`QueryRead`, `Open`,
`PointInTimeAccessor`; see [MVCC Snapshot Visibility](./mvcc-snapshot-visibility.md) for those call sites). What's
observable from the outside is purely a correctness property: a snapshot read keeps returning the right value
across concurrent writes *and* concurrent cleanup, with no window where compaction running in the background
causes a read to regress to an older or wrong revision.

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- **No break-on-first-too-new** — the walk always covers the full chain; a later-slotted revision with a lower
  TSN than an earlier-slotted one (a relocation artifact of cleanup) is never mistaken for "we've gone too far".
- **Latest-by-TSN wins among visible candidates** — ties cannot occur (TSNs are unique per commit), so resolution
  is always deterministic.
- **Read cost scales with chain length** — a hot component with many outstanding revisions (e.g. a long-lived
  reader holding old ones alive) makes every read on it walk further; this is exactly what the revision garbage
  collector bounds by reclaiming entries no live snapshot can still need.
- **Single-entry fast path takes no lock** — the steady-state case (no overflow chunk, already committed) reads
  the header and one element directly, skipping `RevisionEnumerator` construction and the shared-lock acquire
  that the general walk needs to stay consistent against concurrent compaction.

## 🧪 Tests

- [ChaosStressTests](../../../test/Typhon.Engine.Tests/Data/ChaosStressTests.cs) — `RevisionChainDepth_DeepChainWithCleanup` and `SentinelRevision_StaggeredReaderRelease` interleave writes with staggered/out-of-order reader release so background compaction runs concurrently with reads, then assert every reader still resolves its own snapshot correctly (no regression to a stale or wrong revision)
